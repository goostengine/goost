		[b]Experimental![/b] A script which combines several other [Script] resources to extend object's run-time functionality.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[MixinScript] is a [Script] which allows to simulate a new class by fusing other [Script] resources into one. [MixinScript] is a cross-language implementation of the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin]Mixin[/url] programming concept.
		All objects that use [MixinScript] can have properties, methods and signals to be available in the same instance.
		Mixin scripts are added either via editor or code using [method add_mixin]. All mixin scripts added to [MixinScript] must inherit from [Mixin] class. [MixinScript] use internal [Mixin] instances to extend the behavior of the owner. You can treat [Mixin] objects as if they were the owners themselves, since all properties, methods and signals are going to be available in the owner at run-time, and are allowed to override virtual methods such as [method Node._ready], even if they don't exist in the [Mixin] class. But do note that some languages like [GDScript] won't be able to provide features like autocompletion, because in most cases, [Mixin] class may not represent the owner's real base class.
		If scripts share the same properties, methods or signals, only the first occurrence of those will be used throughout scripts. This means that name conflict resolution is implicit, so you may want to change the order of mixin scripts via editor or using [method move_mixin] method at run-time.
		Depending on the language, properties, methods and signals may not be directly available in the [Mixin] classes, but an [b]instance[/b] of the class. Due to the nature of cross-language implementation, those languages might not be aware of the mixin mechanism used by [MixinScript], leading to parse errors as seen in [GDScript].

	<methods>
		<method name="add_mixin">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="script" type="Script" />
			<description>
				Adds a new script to extend the behavior of the owner.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="clear_mixins">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Removes all mixins from this script.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_mixin" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Script" />
			<argument index="0" name="index" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns a script at index previously added with [method add_mixin].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_mixin_count" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the total number of scripts in [MixinScript].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="insert_mixin">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="position" type="int" />
			<argument index="1" name="script" type="Script" />
			<description>
				Inserts a new script at a given position in the array of mixins. The behavior is equivalent to [method Array.insert].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="move_mixin">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="position" type="int" />
			<argument index="1" name="script" type="Script" />
			<description>
				Moves an existing script to a different position (order) among the other scripts. Since calls, signals, etc are performed in script order, changing the order of scripts may be necessary.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="remove_mixin">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="index" type="int" />
			<description>
				Removes an existing script at index. The functionality of the old script will no longer be available in the instance that uses [MixinScript].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_mixin">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="index" type="int" />
			<argument index="1" name="script" type="Script" />
			<description>
				Changes the script at index. The functionality of the old script will no longer be available in the instance that uses [MixinScript].
