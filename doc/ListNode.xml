	<brief_description>
		A single element in the [LinkedList].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The list node is an elemental building block which represent the entire structure of [LinkedList]s. It has [member next] and [member prev] properties which are assigned whenever a new element is inserted into the list, such as using [method LinkedList.push_back].
		[b]Warning:[/b] do not use [method Object.free] to remove this node from the list it belongs to (unless it is instantiated manually with [code]ListNode.new()[/code]), call [method erase] instead which allows the list to update neighbor node references as well.

	<members>
		<member name="next" type="ListNode" setter="" getter="get_next">
			The next node this node points to in the [LinkedList]. If [code]null[/code], then this node is the last element in the list, which is equivalent to [member LinkedList.back].

		<member name="prev" type="ListNode" setter="" getter="get_prev">
			The previous node this node points to in the [LinkedList]. If [code]null[/code], then this node is the first element in the list, which is equivalent to [member LinkedList.front].
		</member>
		<member name="value" type="Variant" setter="set_value" getter="get_value">
			The data this node holds, usually initialized with the list methods such as [method LinkedList.push_back]. Can be anything, including other [LinkedList]s.
