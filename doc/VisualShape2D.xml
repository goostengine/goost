	<brief_description>
		Draws any [Shape2D] resource. Useful for quick prototyping and debugging.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is a node with the entire purpose of rendering [Shape2D] resources just like collision shapes are drawn in the editor, yet it's also possible to override the color per each node rather than globally with this class. You may use Godot's [Polygon2D] node which is much more suitable for polygon editing and drawing with textures, as any shape can be represented with it.

		<method name="update_parent_shape">
			<return type="bool">
			</return>
			<description>
				Forces to update the shape from parent node. This is called automatically each [b]idle frame[/b] if [member use_parent_shape] is enabled. Updating the shape each frame may be costly, so you can disable this behavior with [code]set_process(false)[/code] on this node, and update the shape manually with this method when needed.

		<member name="shape" type="Shape2D" setter="set_shape" getter="get_shape">
			The shape resource used as a reference to draw. The drawing method is specific for each shape and the properties must be configured per shape.

			If [code]true[/code], the shape is fetched from the parent node to draw instead of its own [member shape]. The parent node must have either [code]shape[/code] [Shape2D] property or [code]polygon[/code] [PoolVector2Array] property defined, else nothing is drawn.
