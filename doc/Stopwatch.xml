		A stopwatch to measure time intervals.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A stopwatch allows to measure time intervals. It can measure elapsed time for one interval, or the total of elapsed time across multiple time intervals. To start measuring a time interval, call [method start], then eventually call [method stop], and then check [member time_elapsed].
		[codeblock]
		extends Node

		func _ready():
		    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.new()
		    add_child(stopwatch)
		    stopwatch.start()
		    yield(get_tree().create_timer(1))
		    stopwatch.stop()
		    print(stopwatch.time_elapsed) # Prints 1.0
		[/codeblock]
		Measurement can be resumed with successive [method start] calls. Each call to [method stop] ends the current interval measurement and freezes the cumulative elapsed time value, which also emits the [signal interval_measured] signal. Use method [method reset] to clear the elapsed time to zero in order to measure new time intervals.
		Since the class is used to measure time intervals between existing events of interest, the stopwatch does not have a notion of maximum elapsed time, nor does have a timeout signal. Use [Timer] node for this purpose instead.

	<methods>
		<method name="is_stopped" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool">
			</return>
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the stopwatch is stopped (or inactive).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="reset">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<description>
				Stops time interval measurement and resets the [member time_elapsed] to zero. The stopwatch cannot be reset if it's already running. In that case, call [method stop] before resetting the stopwatch.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="start">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<description>
				Starts (or resumes) measuring elapsed time for an interval.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="stop">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<description>
				Stops measuring elapsed time for an interval. Emits the [signal interval_measured]. You can reset the stopwatch to zero by calling [method reset] manually.

				Emitted when the stopwatch stops the measurement of a time interval. The [code]time_interval[/code] is the difference between elapsed times between [method start] and [method stop] calls. The signal also provides the start and stop times via [code]time_start[/code] and [code]time_stop[/code] respectively.
				If the stopwatch is started and then immediately stopped, the signal is not emitted.
