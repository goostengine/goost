	<brief_description>
		The base class for implementing decomposition or mesh-based classes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Takes outlines from [PolyNode2D] added as children of this node and decomposes them into shapes determined by [member build_mode].
		This class is used as a base for classes such as [PolyCollisionShape2D] and other related mesh-based objects in 2D.

	<methods>
		<method name="_apply_shapes" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Called whenever [PolyNode2D] outlines are updated, [PolyNode2D] children are added/removed, and when [member build_mode] is changed.
				Use [method get_shapes] to construct new entities such as collision [Shape2D]s from outlines. See also [PolyCollisionShape2D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_shapes">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an array of [PoolVector2Array] polygon outlines previously built from [member build_mode].
			</description>
		</method>
	</methods>
	<members>
		<member name="build_mode" type="int" setter="set_build_mode" getter="get_build_mode" enum="PolyShape2D.BuildMode" default="0">
			The mode to build shapes from [PolyNode2D] children.
		</member>
	</members>
	<signals>
		<signal name="shapes_applied">
			<description>
				Emitted whenever the shapes are built and applied to some other object. The signal is emitted after [method _apply_shapes] is called in all cases, so you don't have to emit the signal manually.
