	<brief_description>
		Represents a single polygon node in the hierarchy of nested polygons.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A data structure which is used to receive solutions from clipping and offsetting operations. It's an alternative to the array-based data structures which also receive these solutions in [GoostGeometry2D]. The class has a major advantage over the [Array] structure by having an ability to properly represent the parent-child relationships of the returned polygons. However, since this is a more complex structure, and since it's more computationally expensive to process, it should only be used when parent-child polygon relationships are needed.

		<method name="clear">
			<return type="void">

			<description>
				Removes all [PolyNode2D] children.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_child">
			<return type="PolyNode2D">
			</return>
			<argument index="0" name="index" type="int">
			</argument>
			<description>
				Returns a child node by its index (see [method get_child_count]). This method can be used for iterating all children of a node.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_child_count" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int">
			</return>
			<description>
				Returns the number of child nodes.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_children" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array">
			</return>
			<description>
				Returns an array of references to node's children.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_parent" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PolyNode2D">
			</return>
			<description>
				Returns the parent node of the current node, or an empty [PolyNode2D] if the node lacks a parent.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_hole" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool">
			</return>
			<description>
				Tells whether the [PolyNode2D]'s polygon is a hole.
				Children of outer polygons are always holes, and children of holes are always (nested) outer polygons.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="new_child">
			<return type="PolyNode2D">
			</return>
			<argument index="0" name="path" type="PoolVector2Array">
			</argument>
			<description>
				Constructs a new [PolyNode2D] using the [code]path[/code] polygon vertices.
			</description>
		</method>
