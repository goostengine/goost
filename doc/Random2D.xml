		Randomization methods in 2D.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A singleton which provides various randomization methods relating to 2D space.
		[b]Note:[/b] [Random2D] inherits all the methods from [Random], but has a separate global instance and is treated separately from the base one. This means that the seed and the state are not shared between instances by default.

		<method name="point_in_circle">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<argument index="0" name="radius_min" type="float" default="0.0" />
			<argument index="1" name="radius_max" type="float" default="1.0" />
			<description>
				Generates a random point uniformly distributed on the circle's boundary, within the circle's area, or the area confined by inner and outer circle ranges specified with [code]radius_min[/code] and [code]radius_max[/code] parameters.
				By default, generates points inside unit circle with radius [code]1.0[/code]. If you need random normalized vectors, use [member direction] instead, which is more efficient to compute.
				If [code]radius_min == 0[/code], generates points inside a unit circle, such that [method Geometry.is_point_in_circle] shall return [code]true[/code] given the same radius.
				If [code]radius_min != radius_max[/code], generates points within the ring's area, such that the inner area defined by [code]radius_min[/code] remains unaffected.
				If [code]radius_min == radius_max[/code], generates points exactly [b]on[/b] the circle's boundary, but do note that a point may slightly deviate from the actual circle's boundary due to floating point error accumulation.
				[codeblock]
				var point: Vector2()
				point = Random2D.point_in_circle(1.0, 1.0) # Unit vector.
				point = Random2D.point_in_circle(0.0, 1.0) # Inside a circle.
				point = Random2D.point_in_circle(0.5, 1.0) # Within a ring.
				[/codeblock]
				The parameters are not restricted to unit length of [code]1.0[/code].

		<method name="point_in_polygon">
			<return type="Variant" />
			<argument index="0" name="polygon" type="Variant" />
			<argument index="1" name="point_count" type="int" default="1" />
			<description>
				Generates a random point distributed within polygon's area. The distribution may not be completely uniform, but should be good enough in most cases. If [code]point_count == 1[/code], returns a single [Vector2] point. If [code]point_count &gt; 1[/code], returns a [PoolVector2Array] of points, which can be cached for further usage. This improves performance significantly as the polygon must be triangulated first.
				This works by first decomposing polygons into triangles with [method PolyDecomp2D.decompose_polygons]. For approximately uniform distribution, each triangle is weighted by its area to fetch the needed number of points. Random points are then generated with [method point_in_triangle] uniformly.
				Polygons may consist of outer and inner polygons (holes), so the [code]polygon[/code] parameter also accepts an [Array] of [PoolVector2Array]s as input.
				The quality of distribution works better for single polygons with arbitrary number of holes, so it's recommended to use this method on distinct, non-overlapping objects.

				var point = Random2D.point_in_region(rect)
